TODO:
- maybe more swithes and show more info in the future

update:
- all switches works with no bug
- fix hidden file/dir wrong order bug

2019 jan 19
- simplified the if else structure
- deleted all the unnecessary System.out.println
- create final static Strings for box drawing unicodes
- show the information of the dir depending on the switches entered, 
    for example, if -d, only show numbers of the dirs, not the number of the files and hidden files.

2019 jan 21
- on mimi, the hidden files and dirs can be placed behind the visible files/dirs in the array,
  that messed up the last box drawing, finally fixed it today.
